I use dataset from Kaggle 
Here is the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedshahriarsakib/usa-real-estate-dataset/code

so i use pandas library for data manipulation and Apache-airflow to make a data pipline:

First step : i extract the data from the kaggle that i provided the link.
Second step : i transform Broker_by column from Number (Because it is encoded) to a Broker ID (I just want to make this column more understandable)
Third Step : i Transofo
